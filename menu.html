        A burger is a sandwich consisting of a cooked patty, typically of ground meat, placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The term "burger" is a casual shorthand for "hamburger" but can refer to a variety of other protein or vegetable patties. The classic hamburger is an iconic American fast food, though its precise origins are a subject of debate.
